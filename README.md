# `ToFFi Toolbox`

This repository contains the software related to the publication [ToFFi - Toolbox for frequency-based fingerprinting of brain signals](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2023.126236), published 24th April 2023 in Neurocomputing journal, by Micha≈Ç Konrad Komorowski ([@micholeodon](https://github.com/micholeodon)) from Neurocognitive Laboratory at Nicolaus Copernicus University, Torun, Poland, and his collaborators.

## Abstract

*Spectral Fingerprints* (SFs) are unique power spectra signatures of human brain regions of interest (ROIs, [Keitel & Gross, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002498)). SFs allow for accurate ROI identification and can serve as biomarkers of differences exhibited by non-neurotypical groups. At present, there are no open-source, versatile tools to perform Spectral Fingerprinting. 

We have filled this gap by creating a modular, highly-configurable MATLAB **Toolbox for Frequency-based Fingerprinting (ToFFi)**. It can transform MEG/EEG signals into unique spectral representations using ROIs provided by anatomical (AAL, Desikan-Killiany), functional (Schaefer), or other custom volumetric brain parcellations. Toolbox design supports reproducibility and parallel computations.


# Prerequisites

  * **MATLAB** (version R2021a or newer)
  * **FieldTrip** toolbox (version 20210816 or newer)

The following toolboxes need to be installed alongside MATLAB:
  * Signal Processing Toolbox,
  * Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox,
  * Parallel Computing Toolbox.


# Installation

1. Clone, or download this repository as a `.zip` file and unpack.
2. The ToFFi toolbox is ready to use.
